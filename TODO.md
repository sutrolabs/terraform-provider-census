## Notes

- **This TODO is tracked in version control** and should be updated with every significant change
- **Priority can shift** based on user feedback and Census API changes
- **Each major feature** should include: implementation, testing, documentation, and examples
- **Breaking changes** should follow semantic versioning and provide migration paths
