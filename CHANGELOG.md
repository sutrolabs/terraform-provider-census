## [0.2.9] - 2025-01-06

### Fixed
- **Field Mapping Drift with sync_all_properties**: Fixed unwanted Terraform plan diffs for field mappings when using `field_behavior = "sync_all_properties"`. Previously, Census-managed auto-generated mappings would show as drift on every plan, requiring users to add `lifecycle { ignore_changes = [field_mapping] }` as a workaround. Now the provider uses `CustomizeDiff` to intelligently merge user-configured mappings with Census-managed mappings, suppressing diffs for auto-generated fields while still showing changes for explicitly configured mappings.

- **Alert Management**: Fixed alert lifecycle management to follow Terraform best practices. Previously, the provider would omit the `alert_attributes` field when no alerts were configured, causing the Census API to add default alerts on create and preserve existing alerts on update. The provider now always sends `alert_attributes` (as an empty array when no alerts are configured), ensuring:
  - Syncs created without alerts have no alerts (no default alerts added)
  - All alerts can be deleted from a sync by removing all `alert` blocks and applying
  - Terraform state matches user configuration with no unexpected drift
- **Field Mapping Order Drift**: Fixed spurious diffs in `field_mapping` blocks caused by non-deterministic ordering from the Census API. The Census API now exposes a `position` field that represents the canonical order of mappings (set based on the order they appear in API requests). The provider sorts mappings by position before comparing to Terraform state, ensuring:
  - Mappings are always returned in their canonical order
  - Works correctly regardless of `field_order` setting ("mapping_order" or "alphabetical_column_name")
  - Real changes to mapping order are properly detected
  - No spurious diffs when nothing has changed
  - Requires Census API v0.2.9+ for position field support

## [0.2.8] - 2025-12-30

### Fixed
- **Cron Schedule Drift**: Fixed redundant diffs for syncs using cron expressions. When a sync is created with `frequency = "expression"` and a `cron_expression`, Census API returns computed `day`, `hour`, and `minute` values which caused Terraform to detect configuration drift. The provider now ignores these redundant fields when a cron expression is present.

## [0.2.7] - 2025-12-16

### Added
- **429 Rate Limit Handling**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff for HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) responses. The provider now intelligently handles rate limiting by:
  - Respecting `Retry-After` header when provided by the Census API (supports both delay-seconds and HTTP-date formats per RFC 7231)
  - Using exponential backoff with jitter when Retry-After is not present (1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → 16s → 32s → 64s → 90s max)
  - Continuing retries for up to 5 minutes (separate from the 1-minute per-request timeout)
  - Only retrying 429 errors (other errors like 5xx, network failures are not retried and fail immediately)
  - Providing debug and warning logs for retry attempts via Terraform's structured logging
  - Gracefully handling context cancellation and deadline exhaustion

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Removed `type = "hash"` as a valid field mapping type. This option was never implemented in the Census API and had no functional effect (it was treated identically to `type = "direct"`). Any configurations using `type = "hash"` should be changed to `type = "direct"` or simply omit the type field (direct is the default).

### Fixed
- **Documentation**: Fixed extensive drift in resource documentation where examples didn't match actual provider implementation:
  - **sync resource**: Fixed all examples to use correct block syntax instead of `jsonencode()`, changed `name` to `label`, fixed `destination_object` to `destination_attributes` block, fixed `field_mapping` and `alert` from array syntax to multiple blocks
  - **destination resource**: Fixed field references from `credentials` to `connection_config`, updated exported attributes from `connection_status` to `status` and `test_status`
  - **source resource**: Fixed field references from `credentials` to `connection_config`, updated exported attributes from `connection_status` to `status` and `test_status`
  - Added Google Sheets sync example demonstrating mirror operation with auto-mapping

## [0.2.6] - 2025-12-16

### Fixed
- **Sync Schedule Type Mismatch**: Fixed critical bug where `schedule_day` field type mismatch caused "Provider produced inconsistent result after apply" errors when creating syncs with cron-based schedules. The Census API returns `schedule_day` as a string (e.g., "Monday"), but the provider struct expected `*int`, causing JSON unmarshaling to silently fail. Changed `schedule_day` to `*string` to match the API contract.

## [0.2.5] - 2025-12-12

### Changed
- Increased HTTP client timeout from 30 seconds to 8 minutes to better handle high-latency scenarios, particularly for creating syncs, which can take a few minutes. This prevents premature client-side timeouts while Census API operations are still processing, reducing state drift and improving reliability when creating large numbers of resources.

## [0.2.4] - 2025-12-03

### Fixed
- **Sync Update API Format**: Fixed sync updates to use OpenAPI-compliant `mappings` field ([]MappingAttributes) instead of `field_mappings` ([]FieldMapping). This ensures sync updates are properly formatted for the Census API.
- **Liquid Template Mapping Format**: Fixed liquid_template mappings to send the template string directly to the API (`"{{ template }}"`) instead of incorrectly wrapping it in a hash (`{"liquid_template": "{{ template }}"}`). This resolves errors when creating or updating syncs with liquid template mappings.
- **Alert ID Preservation**: Fixed alert updates to preserve existing alert IDs, preventing API errors during sync updates.

### Added
- Comprehensive unit tests for mapping format conversions (9 new test cases)
- Debug logging to help diagnose sync update issues
- Export conversion functions (ConvertFieldMappingsToMappingAttributes, ConvertMappingAttributesToFieldMappings) for testability

## [0.2.3] - 2025-12-02

### Fixed
- Fix ghost alert entries appearing when removing alerts from syncs. This was caused by a Terraform SDK bug with TypeSet that creates zero-value entries during removal operations (N→N-1 or N→0). The fix migrates alert storage from TypeSet to TypeList, addressing the root cause. State is automatically compatible between versions - no manual migration needed.

## [0.2.2] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed
- Fix Snowflake source validation to support keypair authentication. The provider now correctly handles `show.unless` conditions in field metadata, allowing sources to be created with `use_keypair=true` without requiring a password field.

## [0.2.1] - 2025-11-25

### Fixed
- Remove client-side validation for primary identifiers in sync resources. The Census API now handles this validation, fixing issues with certain destination types like Google Sheets that don't require explicit primary identifier mappings. ([#1](https://github.com/sutrolabs/terraform-provider-census/issues/1))
- Fix sync `paused` attribute not updating correctly when changing from `true` to `false`. Removed `omitempty` JSON tag from boolean field to ensure the value is always sent to the API.
